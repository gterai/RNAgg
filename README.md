# How to install
RNAgg has been tested in a Linux environment running on an Intel64 (x86_64) architecture. It is compatible with Python 3.10.2 and, for GPU acceleration, supports CUDA 11.8.

## Installation Instructions
To install RNAgg, please follow these steps:
```
git clone https://github.com/gterai/RNAgg # Clone the repository
cd RNAgg  # Navigate to the RNAgg directory
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install the required dependencies
cd scripts  # Navigate to the scripts directory
```

## Using Different Environments
If you plan to use a different operating system, Python version, or CUDA version, you may need to install appropriate package versions that are compatible with your environment. Below is a list of key dependencies required for RNAgg:
```
numpy
torch
matplotlib
joblib
umap-learn
```
We recommend ensuring that the versions of these libraries are compatible with your system configuration to avoid potential issues.

# Training
```
python RNAgg_train.py ../example/sample_input.txt
```
This will create the model_RNAgg.pth file which contains the parameters of a trained VAE.

# Generation
```
python RNAgg_generate.py 10 model_RNAgg.pth output.txt
```
This will output 10 generated RNA sequences and their secondary structures in the output.txt file.

# Training considering RNA avtivity
```
python RNAgg_train.py ../example/sample_input.txt --act_fname ../example/sample_act.txt
```
This will output model_RNAgg.pth which contains the parameters of a trained VAE considering
RNA activity as well as sequence and structure.

# Drawing latent space
```
python gg_get_embedding.py ../example/sample_input.txt model_RNAgg.pth emb.pickle
```
This will convert input data into 8-dimensional latent vectors and save it as the emb.pickle file.

```
python gg_draw_latent.py emb.pickle
```
This will convert the latent vectors to 2 dimensionals vectors with the UMAP algorithm and output them as the latent.png file.

```
python gg_draw_latent.py emb.pickle --color_fname ../example/sample_act.txt
```
If you want to color the latent vectors, specify the color using the --color_fname option.

# File format
The input file (sample_input.txt) has three columns separeted by a white space, where the first, second, and third column are identifier, RNA sequence and secondary structure, respectively (for example, see the sample_input.txt file).
The format of output file is the same as the input file. The activity file has two columns separeted by a white space, where the first and second column are identifier and activity value, respectively.
